# MMPoF-Old
 My previous working copy of MMPoF.com that has since been completely overhauled

Top level .aspx files were the public facing website.  The "Protected" subfolder contains the password protected section of the site exclusively for my trivia team members on which they could add new questions as read over the radio, edit existing questions, submit guesses for the open questions, mark answers that had already been called in, manage the open questions, and a variety of other tasks the team needed.  After building this and tweaking it for a handful of years, the team decided a team of them wished to replace it with an all new app built using Javascript, Angular, and Firebase.
